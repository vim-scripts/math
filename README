This plugin has three parts, a keymap, a menu for inserting math symbols, and a few maps.  The characters produced are in utf-8.

The Keymap:

  :set kmp=math

  Uses vim's keymap support to define key sequences which elicit Greek
  upper case and lower case symbols, superscripts, subscripts, "vulgar"
  fractions, arrows, grouping symbols, operators, relational symbols,
  set symbols, and of course the ever popular miscellaneous.

The Menu:
  To enable the menu, use the mouse to select  [DrChip.MathKeys.Enable].
  This menu operates in the insert/replace/ex mode; when in insert/replace/ex,
  use the mouse to select a symbol from the various menus and it will be
  inserted.

The Maps:
  While in visual block mode, and if :MathStart has been run:
  _  will make various symbols into subscript symbols (numbers, vowels)
  ^ will make various symbols into superscript symbols
  & will transform symbols into related math symbols (- into a division line, roman alphabet into Greek, etc)
